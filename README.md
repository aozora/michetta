# michetta
Michetta is a simple static site generator based on [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/): 
the goal is to generate pure HTML without any Vue.js script, but leveraging the component model of Vue.js Single File Components
 and SSR for advanced templating.
Michetta [miˈketta] (also known as rosetta [roˈzetta] "small rose") is an Italian white bread, recognizable from its bulged shape.

## How it works
Leverage Vue.js SSR without generatig any client-side assets.
